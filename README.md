<h1 align='center'>Hi üëãüèº</h1>

It's nice to have you here and thanks for sponsoring!

Your sponsorships are meaning a lot to me as them support me focusing on maintaining my projects and dreaming up new ideas instead of worrying much about money.

In this GitHub organization, I have several private working-in-progress projects that sponsors reaching certain tiers can have early access to them and give early feedback/requests, or even participate with decision making, those might affect how and where the projects go.

When I feel one project is good enough to be publizied, I might transfer it to my main account [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu), or form a new organization with its collaborators, depends on the project. Either these two ways, your name will be featured in the project's README as its Sponsors.

You may also find my projects that already open-sourced in [this page](https://antfu.me/projects).

[Sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/antfu) if you like my work and get interested in this program.
